Parse Integer

Description

Dave is studying about JavaScript. He just learnt an awesome  function to convert a string into integer.

Six months ago, he had written a useless code, which produces a random string line of alphabets (uppercase and lowercase) digits and white spaces.
It has no special characters.

input : the 5is 108 seCONd4 a
output: 117

explaination is 5+108+4=117;

time execution : 10sec

Code:



//read the variable from STDIN
process.stdin.on('data', function(chunk) {
var lines = chunk.tostring().split("\n'),
a = parseInt(lines[0])
//output the variable to STDOUT
console.log(a)
})
